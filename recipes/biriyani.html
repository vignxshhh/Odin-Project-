    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Â½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>2 small green chile peppers</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <p>
          Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and
          vinegar. Add onion; cook and stir until golden and tender. Add
          tomatoes, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger paste. Cook and stir until
          tomatoes are tender. Season with garam masala, mint, salt, and pepper.
          Stir in cilantro.

          Place chicken into tomato-onion mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat to
          medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until
          chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear,
          about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into meat
          should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

          Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Mix in
          cinnamon stick, bay leaf, green cardamom, and black cardamom. Season
          with salt. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender
          and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick, bay
          leaf, and cardamom.
        </p>

          Spread 1/2 of the cooked rice in the bottom of a large serving dish.
          Pour chicken mixture on top. Cover with remaining cooked rice.
          Sprinkle with food coloring; mix to serve.
